**Google Women Techmakers Scholarship 2017**

I got this great opportunity to be a part of Google Women Techmakers Scholars in 2017. A total of about 71 candidates were selected from 13 different countries. Retreat was in Google Seoul office, South Korea. These were most amazing 4 days of learning and fun.

It was a wonderful experience. I got to meet so many amazing people from different regions. Google took care of all our flights and accommodation. Retreat began with a welcome dinner and karaoke. And then for next three days, sessions were conducted in Google Seoul office. Apart from fun, I got to learn a lot from Googlers and other scholars. These sessions made me explore different technologies Google is working on, how to deal with bias and much more. There were interactive workshops on CS Unplugged(It’s awesome. Give it a look), building our personal brand etc. I got to interact with other scholars, Googlers and we all shared our stories of failure and success. In the end, we also got to explore Seoul a little (Thanks to Google Women Techmakers team). We managed time to visit Changdeokgung palace and Seoul tower. It was beautiful. In all, the retreat was a power pack full of fun, inspiration and motivation.

And yes, don’t forget the swags you get.
