Hey, thanks for landing on this page and checking out a more extensive version of my humble-brag page ðŸ˜„

## Why

This corner of the internet helps me clarify and improve my own thinking. Its a mechanism to cope with my chaotic brain that constantly comes up with thoughts or comprehensions of the world concepts but sometimes has conflicts or struggles to structure and organize them.

I believe writing is a superpower that most people are yet to discover, because its mainly a path to understanding yourself and sense-making of a rapidly changing world we live in.

## Who

I currently work as a product manager at a tech company and formerly a go-to-market executive. In my free time I am also learning to code, design and writing bi-weekly essays about life & work.

When possible I also help founders and entrepreneurs with product, growth, talent acquisition and fundraising via Calm Company Fund where I am engaged as a scout and a small investor. If you are building a startup, give me a shout!

## Professional milestones

- **2010** - Landed my first job in [private equity fund](https://www.enercap.com/) and helped raise **over $200m in debt financing** for renewable energy projects in CEE (solar & wind).

- **2011** - Started my first startup in that copied an [ecommerce business model](https://thehustle.co/how-one-of-the-worlds-fastest-growing-startups-burned-through-300m/) from US. After incorporation, printing flyers and business cards we still had 0 customers and learned a lot how not to start a company.
- **2012** - Moved to Berlin during the boom of start-up copycat models and joined a growing [venture studio](https://ioniq.com/portfolio/) that is now spanning fintech, adtech and healthech portfolio.

- **2014** - Created my own mobile user acquisition agency and reached **$30k in revenue the first month**. It was the first digital nomad experience whilst living and travelling in Thailand.
- **2015** - Joined a [seed stage startup](https://venturebeat.com/2014/10/03/1-million-seed-funding-led-by-point-nine-capital-investing-in-remerge-was-a-no-brainer-for-us/) in Berlin and went from 0 revenue to one of the industry leaders in mobile advertising. We grew **from 10 people to 160 employees** and I was lucky to firsthand experience **0 to 1 startup scale-up** including market launch in 7 different countries.

- **2016** - a group of friends started mining something called ethereum and thanks to a good advice I bought some more to reinvest into ICO craze of 2017. I spent the next year learning about blockchain, cryptocurrencies and launched my first newsletter which aggregated around **300 people in the first few months**.

- **2018** - Moved to Singapore to work with the the largest marketplace in SEA on a platform utilising blockchain and external data to find bad actors and prevent malicious behavior before it happens.

- **2020** - Got accepted into an [early-stage start-up programme](https://www.antler.co/) and worked on a machine learning platform. In the end we decided not to pursue the venture funded route, more on this in the future blog post.

- **NOW** - I am exploring investments into profitable SaaS companies, building rapid MVPs and developing a digital garden / second brain via personal knowledge management tools like [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).

My passion is never-ending search for knowledge, learning and leading an examined life.

This websites serves as my playground for for experimenting with ideas, products, thoughts and figuring out how the world works.
