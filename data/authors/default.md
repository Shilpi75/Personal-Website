Iâ€™m a former go-to-market executive turned product manager, ocasional tinkerer of minimal viable products and life-long learner. Here are a few interesting things I've done:

- Landed my first job in private equity and helped raise over $200m in debt financing for renewable energy projects in CEE (solar & wind).
- Started my first business in 2012 that copied an ecommerce business model from US hoping for an acquistion. Failed miserably after incorporating and printing business cards but realizing that there are no customers.
- Moved to Berlin during the boom of start-up copycat models and joined a rapidly growing [venture studio](https://ioniq.com/portfolio/) that is now spanning fintech, adtech and healthech portfolio.
