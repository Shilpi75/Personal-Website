Iâ€™m a former go-to-market executive turned product manager, ocasional tinkerer of minimal viable products and life-long learner. Here are a few interesting things I've done:

- Landed my first job in [private equity fund](https://www.enercap.com/) and helped raise over $200m in debt financing for renewable energy projects in CEE (solar & wind).
- Started my first startup in 2012 that copied an ecommerce business model from US hoping for an acquistion. Failed miserably after incorporating and printing business cards but realizing that there is no distribution.
- Moved to Berlin during the boom of start-up copycat models and joined a rapidly growing [venture studio](https://ioniq.com/portfolio/) that is now spanning fintech, adtech and healthech portfolio.
- Created my own mobile user acquisition agency and reached $30k in revenue the first month. It was the first digital nomad experience whilst living in Thailand for a year.
- Joined a [seed stage startup](https://www.remerge.io) in Berlin and went from 0 revenue to one of the industry leaders in mobile advertising. We grew from 10 people to 160 employees and I was lucky to firsthand experience 0 to 1 scale-up including go-to-market in 7 different countries.
- In early 2016 a group of friends started mining something called ethereum. I was happy to tag along and bought some once it hit Coinbase for the first time. I spent the next year learning about blockchain and crypto.
- Worked on a platform utilising emerging technology such as blockchain and machine learning to combine data from various companies with the goal of finding bad actors and preventing malicious behavior before it happens. Remember Minority report?

I like life-long learning, experiments, leading an examined life and never ending exploration of various topics.
