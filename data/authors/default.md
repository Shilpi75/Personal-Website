I'm a former go-to-market executive, currently operating on the intersection of growth and product. In my free time I tinker with rapid MVPs, design, write, investments and experimenting with new things.

A few milestones from my life:

- **2010** - Landed my first job in [private equity fund](https://www.enercap.com/) and helped raise **over $200m in debt financing** for renewable energy projects in CEE (solar & wind).

- **2011** - Started my first startup in that copied an [ecommerce business model](https://thehustle.co/how-one-of-the-worlds-fastest-growing-startups-burned-through-300m/) from US. After incorporation, printing flyers and business cards we still had 0 customers and learned a lot how not to start a company.
- **2012** - Moved to Berlin during the boom of start-up copycat models and joined a growing [venture studio](https://ioniq.com/portfolio/) that is now spanning fintech, adtech and healthech portfolio.

- **2014** - Created my own mobile user acquisition agency and reached **$30k in revenue the first month**. It was the first digital nomad experience whilst living and travelling in Thailand.
- **2015** - Joined a [seed stage startup](https://venturebeat.com/2014/10/03/1-million-seed-funding-led-by-point-nine-capital-investing-in-remerge-was-a-no-brainer-for-us/) in Berlin and went from 0 revenue to one of the industry leaders in mobile advertising. We grew **from 10 people to 160 employees** and I was lucky to firsthand experience **0 to 1 startup scale-up** including market launch in 7 different countries.

- **2016** - a group of friends started mining something called ethereum and thanks to a good advice I bought some more to reinvest into ICO craze of 2017. I spent the next year learning about blockchain, cryptocurrencies and launched my first newsletter which aggregated around **300 people in the first few months**.

- **2018** - Moved to Singapore to work with the the largest marketplace in SEA on a platform utilising blockchain and external data to find bad actors and prevent malicious behavior before it happens.

- **2020** - Got accepted into an [early-stage start-up programme](https://www.antler.co/) and worked on a machine learning platform. In the end we decided not to pursue the venture funded route, more on this in the future blog post.

- **NOW** - I am exploring investments into profitable SaaS companies, building rapid MVPs and developing a digital garden / second brain via personal knowledge management tools like [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).

My passion is general life design utilising experimentation and never-ending search for knowledge.

This websites serves as my playground for tinkering with ideas, products and thoughts and figuring out how the world works.
