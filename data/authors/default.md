Hey there ðŸ‘‹, thanks for checking a more extensive version of my humble brag!

## Why

This corner of the internet helps me clarify and improve my thinking. It's a mechanism to cope with the chaotic world of information and try to make sense of things whilst resolving various internal conflicts and improving the meta-game in the rapidly changing world.

## Who

I currently work as a principal product manager at a tech BigCo. In my free time, I am building and tinkering with digital products whilst learning to code and design. Occasionally I write essays and long-form articles about exploration, experiments and calm life.

When possible, I also help founders with product, growth, talent acquisition, and fundraising. I am a small investor in:

- ![Calm company fund](https://calmfund.com/)
- ![Replit](https://replit.com/)

Anti-portfolio and wishlist (Didn't invest or dragged too long):

- ![Synthesis school](https://www.synthesis.com/) - online enrichment program for kids ages 8-14 (based on ![Astra Nova](https://www.astranova.org/))
- ![XanPay](https://xanpay.com/) - modern payments for your next billion customers.

## Professional milestones

- **2010** - Landed my first job in [private equity fund](https://www.enercap.com/) and helped raise **over $200m in debt financing** for renewable energy projects in CEE with an impact of saving 130,000 tonnes of carbon p.a. powering 200,000 households.

- **2011** - Started my first startup that copied a [business model](https://thehustle.co/how-one-of-the-worlds-fastest-growing-startups-burned-through-300m/) from US. After incorporation, printing flyers and business cards, we realized we had 0 customers. Learned how not to start a company.

- **2012** - Moved to Berlin during the boom of start-up copycat models and joined a growing [venture studio](https://ioniq.com/portfolio/) that is now spanning fintech, adtech and healthech portfolio. This has been a fantastic experience in understanding shifting technology cycles. We saw mobile overtaking web traffic from the front-row seats and opportunities it brought.

- **2014** - Started a mobile-first user acquisition agency and reached **$30k in revenue the first month**. It was the first digital nomad experience whilst living and travelling in Thailand. A year later my bank sent me a cease and decist letter and I had to close down. I learned a lot about preserverance and stress but also independence and non-default paths.

- **2015** - Joined a [seed stage startup](https://venturebeat.com/2014/10/03/1-million-seed-funding-led-by-point-nine-capital-investing-in-remerge-was-a-no-brainer-for-us/) in Berlin and went from 0 revenue to one of the industry leaders in mobile advertising. We grew **from 10 people to 160 employees** and I was lucky to experience a true **0 to 1 startup scale-up story** including market launch in 7 different countries.

- **2016** - Took a career break and spent time with my family. Also learned about ethereum and participated in ICO wave of 2017. Spent the year learning to code, understanding crypto and launched a newsletter focusing on educational content.

- **2018** - Made a move to Singapore and worked with the largest C2C marketplace in SEA on a platform utilising blockchain and external data to identify bad actors. Met some of the most amazing entrepreneurs in the region and engraved myself in the VC ecosystem.

- **2020** - Got accepted into an [early-stage start-up programme](https://www.antler.co/) and worked on a machine learning ops product to help push models into production faster. This was a breaking point in my own mental model of how the world works, probability and why venture model is not a good fit for majority of the founders. It was such a great experience though that again provided a chance to learn from the best in the industry.

- **2021** - A complete professional fiasco. I got a chance to interview for my dream job, completely messed it up and ended up in a abusive environment, followed by a stint in a feature factory. On a bright side I officially moved to a product manager job!
- **NOW** - I made it to a tech BigCo. The job is pretty challenging from technical and organisational perspective but it nudges growth. Other stuff I focus on in my free time:
  - **Code** - I went back part-time self-teaching rabbit-hole because I want to be able to get an API working, or launch a front-end of GPT-3 model, play with procedural algorithmic art. There is just so much cool stuff going on that it makes me feel like I am a kid discovering multiplayer Doom and "IDDQD". Currently working with TypeScript, Next.js, Prisma, tRPC and Supabase/Pocketbase.
  - **Design** - In combination with above, I am also learning about UX/UI and accessibility. I think design is really underrated moat for a lot of products.
  - **Communities** - Trying to be more active in a few communities, mostly focused on solopreneurship and indie-making. I think one of the major contributors to happiness comes from the sense of belonging and having like-minded people around.
  - **Calm companies** - I signed-up for a scout programme from Calm Company Fund and on the lookout for profitable companies or solo devs working on a software product that are seeking to go full-time.
  - **2nd brain** - After 2 years of tinkering with Roam, Logseq, Obsidian. I am back on notion as I love the databases mental model and with their upcoming AI featureset it seems like a no brainer. I take less notes these days and don't need backlinks to feel that I am retaining well. What I did discover though is Raycast which feeds into Notion with a super cool extension called Hypesonic for todos.
  - **Non-default paths** - Being stuck at home during covid really made me think about the choices that I made and path I have chosen. I am a big fan of pathless path and non-conventional journeys of people doing things that are not default. I am still exploring what does it mean for myself though.

Some keywords and phrases that I like to throw around that define my path:

- Living an examined and calm life
- Exploration & experimentation
- Seeking mastery & expertise
- Beginner's mind and art of starting from scratch
- Lifelong learning and forever student
- Non-convention and non-conformity
- Simplicity and minimalism
- Virtue cultivation
- Individual journey and direction
- Bits of hungriness and foolishnesses
