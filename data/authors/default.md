Iâ€™m a former go-to-market executive turned product manager, ocasional tinkerer of minimal viable products and life-long learner. Here are a few interesting things I've done:

- Landed my first job in [private equity fund](https://www.enercap.com/) and helped raise **over $200m in debt financing** for renewable energy projects in CEE (solar & wind).
- Started my first startup in 2012 that copied an ecommerce business model from US hoping for an acquistion. Failed miserably after incorporating and printing business cards but
- Moved to Berlin during the boom of start-up copycat models and joined a rapidly growing [venture studio](https://ioniq.com/portfolio/) that is now spanning fintech, adtech and healthech portfolio.

- Created my own mobile user acquisition agency and reached **$30k in revenue the first month**. It was the first digital nomad experience whilst living and travelling in Thailand.
- Joined a [seed stage startup](https://www.remerge.io) in Berlin and went from 0 revenue to one of the industry leaders in mobile advertising. We grew **from 10 people to 160 employees** and I was lucky to firsthand experience **0 to 1 startup scale-up** including market launch in 7 different countries.

- In early 2016 a group of friends started mining something called ethereum and thanks to a good advice I bought some more to reinvest into ICO craze of 2017. I spent the next year learning about blockchain, cryptocurrencies and launched my first newsletter which aggregated around 300 people in the first few months.

- Moved to Singapore to work with the the largest marketplace in SEA on a platform utilising blockchain and external data to find bad actors and prevent malicious behavior before it happens. Remember Minority report?

My passion is to never stop learning and exploring. I am a proponent of examined life and never-ending experiments.

This websites serves as my playground for testing and validating ideas, products and thoughts about how the world works.

### Now

I am currently exploring investments into profitable SaaS companies, building rapid MVPs and personal knowledge management (tools for thought).
